# Formal Notes

This stores a compilation of all the full notes (Study Guides) that I have made in my time at NUS. 

As you can tell, there are not a lot of them as I only really got into the habit later on, and I do not include half-written / messy notes. The format of the notes themselves also vary in terms of whether it is Latex'ed or Handwritten (generally dependent on whether there are a lot of graphs and figures involved).

I will (hopefully) continue to expand this to include other topics that I am studying even after I graduate.
